## Gas Deck Shield using the Arduino Feather M4 CAN Express
In this project, we start with a number of files that are automatically
generated by Atmel START. I have copied these to new files to protect
them from being overwritten by new START updates. It is important to
notice changes to the generated files, as those changes may need to
be propagated to the copied files.

 - main.c: gds_main.c
 - atmel_start.[ch]: incorporated into gds_main.[ch]
 - atmel_start_pins.h: gds_pins.h
 - driver_init.[ch]: gds_driver_init.[ch]
 - usb_start.[ch]: gds_usb.[ch]

The original generated files must be removed from the project
without deleting so we can track changes.
